To run locally:

bundle exec jekyll serve --watch

Smooth Yak policy:
- to use syntax colouring, we require Pygments https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pygments
- locally, maybe use Rouge to get a similar effect?

to deploy, add your key to the server and run:
`rsync -avz --delete _site/ rails@grafter.org:/home/rails/sites/grafter_docs/`

I recommend adding alias to your profile (e.g)
`alias deploygrafterdocs="rsync -avz --delete _site/ rails@grafter.org:/home/rails/sites/grafter_docs/"`
