title: Setting up a Clojure Environment
---

# Environment

There are many good development environments for Clojure and Grafter
development.  However we strongly believe that if you are new to
Clojure you should use one of the following to simplify your workflow.

One of the biggest advantages of Clojure over other languages is how
powerful its REPL is.  Consequently if you don't have good editor
integration with your REPL you will find development to be
significantly slower.

In particular we recommend the following environments for getting
started quickly with Grafter and Clojure.

## 1. IntelliJ with Cursive Clojure

[IntelliJ](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) with the
[Cursive Clojure plugin](https://cursiveclojure.com/) is one of the
easiest ways of getting a near state of the art Clojure environment
going.

Given how much time many people spend setting up their Clojure
environments unless you're already an Emacs user, we recommend this as
the best option.

## 2. Emacs and Cider

This is typically considered to be the most capable environment for
Clojure development.  However because Emacs isn't for everyone we
hesitate to recomend it as the easiest way to get started.

Perhaps once you've learned Clojure you can graduate to using Emacs
and Cider.

The Emacs learning curve can be quite steep but there are some
[good articles](http://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/) on getting
started with Emacs and Clojure.

## 3. LightTable

LightTable is written in Clojurescript and is one of the easiest
Clojure environments to get started with.  It also has some great
interactive development features such as the instarepl. It is
well-designed, responsive and portable, so can develop and test your
code everywhere. [Download it and try it](http://www.lighttable.com).

Lighttable has some innovative features and is a great environment
however we believe people will appreciate the familiarity of IntelliJ
and Cursive.

## 4. Eclipse + CounterClockWise

[Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org) is a cross-platform IDE which
supports Clojure development through the
[CounterClockWise](http://doc.ccw-ide.org) plugin.

## Other choices

There are many other options, however in our experience people are
always best starting with one of above, before exploring alternatives.
[This question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4248171/choosing-an-ide-editor-for-clojure-coding) on StackOverflow discusses some of the other options for Clojure
development.
