# Environment

Here are three development environment for Clojure / Leiningen project: Emacs, Eclipse + CounterClockWise or LightTable. There are other options, such as Vim, Textmate and SublimeText2, but these three are clojure-oriented and the most common.

## LightTable

LightTable is written in Clojurescript and is one of the easiest Clojure environments to get started with. It also has some great interactive development features such as the instarepl. It is well-designed, responsive and portable, so can develop and test your code everywhere. [Download it and try it](http://www.lighttable.com).

LightTable would be our recommendation for those who are new to Clojure and want to get started quickly, but are unfamiliar with the other options.

## Emacs

Emacs is the most common development environment for lisp languages. The learning curve can be quite steep but there are some [good articles](http://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/) on getting started with Emacs and Clojure.

## Eclipse + CounterClockWise

[Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org) is a cross-platform IDE which supports Clojure development through the [CounterClockWise](http://doc.ccw-ide.org) plugin.
