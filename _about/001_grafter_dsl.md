# The Grafter DSL

At the heart of Grafter is a Domain Specific Langauge (DSL) which
allows the specification of transformation pipelines that convert
tabular data into linked data formats.

The DSL is designed to support a good separation of concerns, and
acknowledges the reality that even within a single dataset many people
with different skills and responsibilities may be involved.
