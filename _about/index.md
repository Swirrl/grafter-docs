# The Grafter DSL

At the heart of Grafter is a Domain Specific Langauge (DSL) which
allows the specification of transformation pipelines that convert
tabular data into linked data formats and the creation of graphs.

The DSL is designed to support a good separation of concerns, and
acknowledges the reality that even within a single dataset many people
with different skills and responsibilities may be involved.

# The Grafter Vision

Grafter has been designed to form the basis of a suite of tools for
creating linked data out of a variety of source formats.  These tools
are concerned not only with transformation, but also data cleaning,
and robust loading with excellent facilities for error handling and
reporting.

At the heart of Grafter is a Domain Specific Langauge (DSL) which
allows the specification of transformation pipelines that convert
tabular data into linked data formats.

The DSL is designed to support a good separation of concerns, and
acknowledges the reality that even within a single dataset many people
with different skills and responsibilities may be involved.

The Grafter suite is designed to allow many people with different
skill sets to efficiently reuse work and collaborate in the process of
data linked data conversion and publication.

The Grafter suite is currently a work in progress, but it is envisaged
to consist of the following tools:

- The underlying Grafter DSLs
- The Grafter Import Service
- A Grafter Transformation Builder
