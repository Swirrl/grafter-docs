# Community & Support

The Grafter project is maintained and sponsored by
[Swirrl](http://swirrl.com/) as part of our Open Source initiatives.
Grafter is an integral part of our work and we're keen to grow and
support an active community of users and developers.

## Join the Mailing List

We're open to participation and supporting users and developers via
our public [Grafter Users Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en-GB#!forum/grafter-users).

## Contributing to Grafter

Grafter is hosted and developed openly on
[Github](https://github.com/Swirrl/grafter) and we intend for Grafter
to remain open under the terms the
[Eclipse Public License](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html)
(the same as Clojure).

However following the lead of [other](http://clojure.org/)
[open source](http://www.ubuntu.com/legal/contributors) projects, we
require contributors to jointly assign their copyright on contributed
code.
