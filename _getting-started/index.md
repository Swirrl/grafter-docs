# Getting Started

This guide will introduce you to Grafter, and will get you up and
running within 20 minutes.

In this guide you will learn how to:

- Create a new Grafter project
- Use Grafter to clean tabular data
- Transform a CSV file and save it as an Excel file (or vice versa)
- Generate Linked Data (RDF) from tabular input data
- Use the Grafter plugin to list and run transformations
- Develop transformations at the Clojure REPL
- Express Grafter transformations

Our grafter template installs a minimal but complete Grafter
transformation so you can get started with Grafter right away.

Lets get started!
