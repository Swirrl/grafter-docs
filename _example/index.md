# Example

This illustrative example shows how you can use Grafter to manufacture linked data from a source CSV file.

Developing a Grafter transformation involves several tasks:

## Main steps

- **[Specify a pipeline](906_pipeline.html)**, of tabular transformations. This is the heart of the Grafter workflow.

- **[Create the graphs fragments](907_graph.html)** we want.

## Other steps

- [Define prefixes and make the URIs](911_making_uri.html) we need for our triples.

- [Filter and export](941_filter_import.html) the graph fragments.

- [Package your transformation as a Leiningen project](951_command_line.html) to be able to graft documents from the command line!
