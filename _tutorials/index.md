# Tutorials

This example demonstrates how you can use Grafter for your RDFization projects and helps you understand what is happening in the engine.

## Tutorials overview

Using Grafter can be decomposed into a number of tasks:

### Main steps

- **[Work and transform the data](906_pipeline.html)**, to make it usable. This is the heart of the Grafter workflow.

- **[Create the graphs fragments](907_graph.html)** we want.

### Other steps
- [Clean data](908_cleaning.html).

- [Define prefixes and make the URIs](911_making_uri.html) we need for our triples.

- [Filter and export](941_filter_import.html) the graph fragments.

- [Package the steps in a Leiningen project](951_command_line.html) to be able to graft documents from the command line! It's a good way to review everything done previously.
