This example aims, with a concrete case, both to present you how you can use Grafter for your RDFization projects and to help you understand what is happening in the engine.

# Tutorials overview

Using Grafter can be decomposed in different part:

- The first part of the process is going to be some [data cleaning](908_cleaning.html). Not the funniest part but is almost  an necessary step for each project.

- The second part is going to be the [definition of every prefixes and the making of URI](911_making_uri.html) we are going to need for our triples

- **Then we will [work and transform the data](921_pipeline.html) we have, to make them usable. This is the most interessting part, it is the engine of the Grafter's process!**

- After that we will be able to [create the graphs frangments we want](931_graph.html)

- There will therefore be a little step: [filter and export](941_filter_import.html)

- And, finally, it's not really in the process but we are going to [wrap every steps in a Leiningen project](951_command_line.html) to be able to graft documents from the command line!
