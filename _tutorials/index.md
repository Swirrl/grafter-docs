# Tutorials

This example aims, with a concrete case, both to present you how you can use Grafter for your RDFization projects and to help you understand what is happening in the engine.

## Tutorials overview

Using Grafter can be decomposed in different part:

### Main steps

- **[Work and transform the data](906_pipeline.html)**, to make them usable. This is the most interessting part, it is the engine of the Grafter's process!

- **[Create the graphs frangments](907_graph.html)** we want.

### Other steps
- [Clean data](908_cleaning.html). Not the funniest part but often a necessary step for each project

- [Define prefixes and make the URIs](911_making_uri.html) we need for our triples.

- [Filter and export](941_filter_import.html) the graph frangments.

- [Wrap every steps in a Leiningen project](951_command_line.html) to be able to graft documents from the command line! It's a good way to review everything we will have done before.
