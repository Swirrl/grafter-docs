# Pipeline

## Principle
As its name indicates, the pipeline function, aims to link the data we are working on and the graph we want. Basically, pipeline modifies, for each row of the CSV file we are working on, the columns, so we can access or add the exact data we need.

## Clojure

### Data
The dataset we are going to use for this exemple comes from Glasgow (Scotland, UK) Open Data.
