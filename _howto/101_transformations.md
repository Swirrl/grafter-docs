##Transformations and the art of preserving source data

You probably don't really want to modify source data, there are a lot of reasons why:

- Source data can be used for something else
- If there is a problem you prefer to know who modified data and why
- Responsability
- You never really know how your code is going to evolve
- You never really know how your data usage is going to evolve
- And so on...

Grafter philosophy is to give you the freedom to choose not to alter source data!
