# Leiningen

Leiningen is the most well supported build tool for Clojure
development and it's what we use for Grafter and our examples.

## Download

You will need to download and [install Leiningen](http://leiningen.org) from their website to follow this quick start guide.

## Grafter
You can simply use Grafter in a Leiningen project by adding it to your <code>:dependencies</code> in <code>project.clj</code>:

{% highlight clojure %}

:dependencies [grafter "0.2.0-SNAPSHOT"]

{% endhighlight %}
