# Environment

Here are three development environment for Clojure / Leiningen project: Emacs, Eclipse + CounterClockWise or LightTable. There are other solutions (vim, Textmate, SublimeText2...) but those three are quite classics and clojure oriented.

## Emacs

Richard Stallman, Rich Hickey, Rick Moynihan can not be all wrong... The learning curve can be quite strong but there are some good articles to [start Clojure + emacs](http://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/)

## Eclipse + CounterClockWise

Since every body else use Eclipse, here you can [download and install CounterClockWise](http://doc.ccw-ide.org), the Eclipse plug-in for Clojure and Leiningen.

## LightTable

LightTable is much more recent, and thus, incomplete, BUT it is written in CLojure and is really Clojure oriented! It's quite fast and design and you can test your code everywhere. [Download it and try it](http://www.lighttable.com).
